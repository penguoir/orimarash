Have you ever wanted to learn something new and not known where to start? I know
I have. I've been trying to learn some world history. I asked a friend of mine
which books to read. I asked another friend which movies to watch. But then,
what next? There are plenty of "History 101" courses online, but none of them
take you to the next step. I could take a course but that wouldn't be as
flexible.

I realised that other people must feel the same way. I tried looking for
solutions online but came up blank. The best syllabuses I found online are in
Quora answers--not very reliable.


The solution is Bluepaper
-------------------------

Here's where [Bluepaper] comes in. Bluepaper syllabuses guide you through entire
fields using project-based learning. From knowing nothing to ready for industry.

Instead of having tutorials or courses, Bluepaper points you to which courses
you should do. For example, instead of explaining HTML, it sends you to the
appropriate Codeacademy course.

Right now, it only has a front-end web development course--the only thing I
know--but we plan to add more courses in the future: theoretical physics,
machine learning, cell biology, etc.
