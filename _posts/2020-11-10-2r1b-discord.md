Two Rooms One Boom is a game which I learned how to play in Year 9. We called it
Communists and Americans but I think the game developers wanted something more
PG. To play it, you need to deal each player a card. You can't really do this
online, so I built a bot which does it for you.

Discord is like Skype for gaming
--------------------------------

Discord is just a place where you can chat with friends and was originally made
with gaming in mind. They've now changed their marketing focus but overall, it's
still just a place to play games online.

There are audio channels and video sharing, as well as text.

Discord allows you to create bots which do thing automatically based on
commands.

So, I decided to make a Discord bot which deals cards out to each player who
wants to play, randomly.


Discord bots work using webhooks
--------------------------------

The way I understand this works, Discord makes a request to your server every
time a message is written (or other events which your bot listens). This request
just contains the user, the message content, and maybe some metadata. With this,
your bot code needs to figure out what to do, then send a response.

This is much more clever than how I thought it works, which is just constantly
making requests to the server, checking for new messages.

There's a Ruby package which does a lot of this for you
-------------------------------------------------------

Since all Discord bots have the same underlying structure, there are packages
for every language which simplifies the process of creating a bot.

Instead of creating a server, doing OAuth with Discord, etc. All you have to do
is run:

```ruby
bot.run
```

Abstraction is pretty great!

I decided to use [`discordrb`](https://github.com/discordrb/discordrb) because I
wanted to write this in Ruby. The documentation is okay, but I had to look
through the source code to understand what's going on. This wasn't as bad as it
sounds, though, as the code has great comments which explain everything.


The game itself isn't complicated
---------------------------------

The bit I needed to worry about isn't the functionality of the actual game, it's
just the automated bits:

  * Let players join the game
  * When the game start, each player gets a card
  * Players need to be able to show each other their card
  * A timer for keeping track of rounds

Let's get started!


Programming is fun
------------------

Here's how I went about programming the game.


### Letting players join the game

I created an array, `joined_player` and every time the `/join` command was run,
the author of that message was added to the array:

```ruby
joined_users = []

bot.command :join do |event|
  return ":x: can't join the game, it's already running" if is_game_started

  user = event.user
  return ":x: you're already in the game" if joined_users.include? user

  joined_users.push(user)

  ":dancer: #{user.name} has joined the 2r1b game."
end
```

### When the game starts, give out cards

_Cards are called "roles" in this game_

When the `/start` command is run, we need to divide the roles between all
players. There's an array called `ROLES` which contains all the roles available
in the game. For each user that has joined, we give them a random role and
delete that role from the `remaining_roles` array.

We also split the players into two rooms, and tell them which room they're in
(this is another part of the game).

```ruby
bot.command :start do |event|
  return ":x: game is already started, `/stop` to stop" if is_game_started
  return ":x: not enough players to start" if joined_users.size < 4

  remaining_roles = ROLES
  is_game_started = true

  joined_users.each do |u|
    # Get a random role
    role = remaining_roles.sample

    # Set the user's role
    u.role = role

    # Delete from possible roles array
    remaining_roles.delete(role)

    # Let the user know about it
    u.pm(role.to_s)
  end

  # Split into teams
  half = joined_users.size/2.to_f

  room_a = joined_users.sample(half.ceil)
  room_b = joined_users - room_a

  ":rocket: Started the game! I've DM\'d #{joined_users.size} players their"\
  " roles. Use `/show @user#1234` and `/swap @user#1234` to show or swap"\
  " cards with a user. \n\n"\
  " **Room A**: #{room_a.map { |u| u.name }.join(', ')}\n"\
  " **Room B**: #{room_b.map { |u| u.name }.join(', ')}"
end
```

### Showing your card

Players need a way of showing their card. This is a mechanic in the game. They
can either show their entire card (`/show_full`) or just their team name
(`/show_team`). Here's the code:

Users will enter a reference to the user they want to show their card to. For
example, player A might show their card to player B like this: `/show B`. The
library was a bit out of whack on this one, so I had to write my own function
which extracts the user from the command arguments (`user_from_args`)

```ruby
def user_from_args(args, bot)
  user_req = Discordrb::API::User.resolve("Bot #{TOKEN}", args.first[2...-1])
  Discordrb::User.new(JSON.parse(user_req.body), bot)
end
```

These commands define `/show_full` and `/show_team`:

_`.pm` sends a private message to the user_

```ruby
bot.command :show_full do |event, *args|
  user_from_args(args, bot).pm(
    "**#{event.user.name} has shown you their card**: #{event.user.role.to_s}"
  )
end

bot.command :show_team do |event, *args|
  user_from_args(args, bot).pm(
    "**#{event.user.name} has shown you their team**: #{event.user.role.team}"
  )
end
```

### Finally, the timer

Each round lasts a few minutes, so I added a timer. This has to be on another
thread to make sure that other commands can still be processed.

```ruby
def start_timer(duration, channel)
  Thread.new {
    sleep duration
    channel.send_message("--- **Timer for #{duration/60} minutes is over!!** ---")
  }
end

timer = nil

##
# Start a timer of (arg) minutes

bot.command :timer do |event, *args|
  return ":x: no duration specified" unless args.first
  duration = args.first.to_f

  timer = start_timer(duration * 60, event.channel)

  "starting a timer for #{duration} minutes"
end

bot.command :stop_timer do |event|
  return "no timer set." if timer.nil?

  timer.kill
  "stopped the timer"
end
```


Conclusion
----------

This was a nice project, and it only took an afternoon to make. The next steps
for this project are to abstract a few things into classes. Also, to automate a
few of the commands (like starting a timer for each round). Further, there is a
lot of game functionality that isn't added here, so I could add that too.

For an extra challenge, I could also make this work for many different games at
the same time.
